| **What**          | On-demand ephemeral environments from GitHub PRs |
| **Origin**        | Built at GoodRx starting 2019                    |
| **License**       | Apache 2.0 (open source)                         |

## The Problem We Faced

In 2019, GoodRx's shift from monolith to microservices created environment chaos:

    A[Developer A] --> D1[Deploys to staging] --> Q1["Is anyone using staging?"]
    B[Developer B] --> D2[Overwrites A's code] --> Q2["Who broke staging?"]
    C[Developer C] --> D3[Waits hours/days] --> Q3[Productivity lost]
`}
/>

Shared staging environments meant constant conflicts, broken deployments, and wasted time.

## The Solution

We built **Lifecycle**: a tool that creates isolated, ephemeral environments for every GitHub pull request.

**Before Lifecycle:**

- Static staging servers with deployment conflicts
- Manual coordination via Slack: "Is staging free?"
- Hours or days waiting to test changes

**After Lifecycle:**

- Every PR gets its own isolated environment
- No coordination needed
- Instant feedback on code changes

## Our Journey

    title Lifecycle Journey
    2019 : Proof of concept
    Early adoption : Engineers loved it : Rapid expansion
    Scaling : Baked into all service templates
    2024 : Open-sourced under Apache 2.0
`}
/>

Key milestones:

1. **Proof of concept** - Handful of services onboarded
2. **Organic growth** - Engineers requested Lifecycle for all projects
3. **Standardization** - Created `lifecycle.yaml` config, replaced manual database entries
4. **Maturity** - Became essential infrastructure at GoodRx

## Why We Open-Sourced

This release represents five years of development, countless iterations, and hard-won lessons. We open-sourced Lifecycle to:

- Help teams escape "environment limbo"
- Build a community of contributors
- See novel use cases we never imagined

## Get Involved

We want to learn from you and grow together.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

Let's quickly validate that the app is able to send events to the Lifecycle app successfully.

- Navigate to your Github app
- Click `App Settings` link in the Github application page
- Choose `Advanced` from the left sidebar
- `Recent Deliveries` section should show a successful delivery of the `installation` event to the Lifecycle app.

  <Callout type="warning">
    If you see an error or no deliveries, make sure the app is installed in the
    atleast one repository and that the webhook URL is set correctly by
    navigating to the `General` section from the left sidebar and checking the
    `Webhook URL` field.
  </Callout>

- If the delivery is successful, you should see a status code of `200 OK`

## Failing deliveries

If you see a delivery failure, it could be due to various reasons. Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

### Github App secrets

- Make sure that the Github App secrets are correctly set in the `lifecycle-app` namespace. You can verify this by running the following command:

```sh
kubectl get secret app-secrets --namespace lifecycle-app \
      -o jsonpath='{.data}' | jq 'with_entries(.value |= @base64d)'
```

- The output should include all the `GITHUB_*` variables with the correct values.

- If the secrets are present but the delivery is still failing, try restarting the following deployments.

```sh
 kubectl rollout restart  deployment lifecycle-web lifecycle-worker -n lifecycle-app
```

- Try triggering a new event (create a pull request) by making a change in the repository or by manually redelivering a failed delivery.

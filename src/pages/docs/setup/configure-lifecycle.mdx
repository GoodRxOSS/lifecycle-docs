We are in the final step of the setup process.

**This step is Optional but highly recommended to ensure the default IP Whitelist is set for the environments created by the Lifecycle app.** This will help in securing the environments and restricting access to only the specified IPs or CIDR blocks.

## Set Default IP Whitelist

- Connect to the `postgres` database using the `psql` command line tool or any other database client.

  <Callout type="info">

  Database password was auto generated during the infra setup and can be found
  retrieved from the `app-postgres` secret in the `lifecycle-app`
  namespace.

  </Callout>

- Retrieve the database password:

```sh
   kubectl get secret app-postgres --namespace lifecycle-app \
      -o jsonpath='{.data}' | jq 'with_entries(.value |= @base64d)'
```

- Run the following SQL commands to update the configuration:

```sql
-- provide a default IP whitelist for the environments, default is open to all IPs
UPDATE public.global_config
SET
    config = (
        config::jsonb ||
        '{
            "defaultIPWhiteList": "{ 0.0.0.0/0 }"
         }'::jsonb
    )::json,
    "updatedAt" = NOW()
WHERE "key" = 'serviceDefaults';
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  Note that the infra setup with the OpenTofu modules below will **open your
  cluster to the world.** <br />
  üõ°Ô∏è Make sure to **<a href="https://translate.google.com/details?sl=auto&tl=hy&text=shield&op=translate">shield</a>** your cluster by implementing appropriate network policies
  and access controls after the initial setup.

Replace the `defaultIPWhiteList` under `global_config.serviceDefaults` with your actual IP whitelist or CIDR block to restrict access to the deployed environments.

</Callout>

## Refresh config cache

```sh
curl -X PUT https://app.<your_domain>/api/v1/config/cache
```

This will refresh the configuration cache and apply the changes you made to the database for the Lifecycle app.

We are all set! üéâ And ready to create our first PR based ephemeral environment.

To create a Github app that will send events to the Lifecycle with necessary permissions, follow these steps:

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you have admin access to the Github organization or account where
  you want to create the app.
</Callout>

- Navigate to your installed Lifecycle app at `https://app.<your_domain>/setup` (replace `<your_domain>` with your actual domain. e.g. `https://app.0env.com/setup`).

- Select `Personal` or `Organization` based on your needs.
- Fill in the required fields:

  - **Github App Name**: A name for your app. (should be unique, use a prefix with your name or organization. Refer Github app naming convention [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/)
  - **Organization Name**: Github organization name where the app will be created. Required if you selected `Organization`.

- Click `Create App`
- On the Github app creation page, confirm the app name and click `Create`
- Once the app is created, you will be redirected to the app installation page where you can choose one or more repositories to install the the newly minted app.

  <Callout type="info">
    Make sure to select the repositories you want the app to have access to. You
    can always change this later in the app settings but **adding atleast one
    repository is required to proceed with the setup**.
  </Callout>

  <br />

- Voila! ðŸŽ‰ Your Github app is now created and installed.

- Click `Configure and Restart` to apply the changes and start using the app.

<Callout type="info">
  The step above, sets up the global config values that Lifecycle app will use
  creating ephemeral environments and processing pull requests. And restarts the
  `deployment` for the github app secrets to take effect.
</Callout>

Let's move on the final step where we will configure the Lifecycle app config for processing pull requests and creating ephemeral environments.

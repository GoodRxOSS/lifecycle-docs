import { Callout } from "nextra/components";
import { Image } from "@lifecycle-docs/components";

Now that the infrastructure components are setup, let's install the lifecycle app and create a new Github app that will send events to the application to process and create ephemeral dev environments.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you have updated the kube config to be able to `helm install` in the
  cluster you just created!
</Callout>

- Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GoodRxOSS/lifecycle
cd lifecycle
```

- Update the custom values file at `/helm/environments/defaults.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  #... other settings

  ingress:
    enabled: true
    ingressClassName: nginx
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
    hosts:
      - host: app.<your_domain_here> # Update this with your domain
        paths: ["/"]
#... other settings
```

- Install the Lifecycle Helm chart:

```sh
helm install lifecycle helm/web-app --namespace lifecycle-app --values ./helm/environments/default/lifecycle.yaml
```

- Wait for the installation to complete and verify that the pods are running:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n lifecycle-app
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to replace values with your actual domain and update the secret name
  accordingly. Secret was created by the opentofu modules in the infrastructure
  setup (`app-<domain>-<tld>`).
</Callout>

- Once the pods are running, you can access the application at your configured domain (e.g. `https://app.0env.com`)

Just like that, you have successfully installed Lifecycle and set up the necessary infrastructure to start creating ephemeral environments for your GitHub pull requests!

Let's move on to the next step where we will create a GitHub app to connect Lifecycle with your repositories.

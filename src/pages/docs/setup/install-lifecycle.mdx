import { Callout } from "nextra/components";
import { Image } from "@lifecycle-docs/components";

Now that the infrastructure components are setup, let's install the lifecycle app and create a new Github app that will send events to the application to process and create ephemeral dev environments.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you have updated the kube config to be able to `helm install` in the
  cluster you just created!
</Callout>

- Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GoodRxOSS/lifecycle
cd lifecycle
```

- Install the Lifecycle Helm chart:

```sh
helm upgrade -i lifecycle helm/web-app --namespace lifecycle-app --values ./helm/environments/default/lifecycle.yaml --set components.web.ingress.hosts\[0\].host=app.<your_domain_here>
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to replace values with your actual domain.
</Callout>

- Wait for the installation to complete and verify that the pods are running:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n lifecycle-app
```

- Once the pods are running, you can access the application at your configured domain (e.g. `https://app.0env.com`)

Just like that, you have successfully installed Lifecycle and set up the necessary infrastructure to start creating ephemeral environments for your GitHub pull requests!

If you notice any secure certificate issues when accessing the application, you can check the status of your certificate using the following command:

```sh
kubectl get certificate -n lifecycle-app
```

<Image
  src="/setup/cert-ready.png"
  width={2572}
  height={844}
  ratio={2572 / 844}
/>

Make sure the certificate is in the `Ready` state. If it is not, you may need to wait a bit longer for the certificate to be issued or troubleshoot any issues with your DNS settings.

Let's move on to the next step where we will create a GitHub app to connect Lifecycle with your repositories.

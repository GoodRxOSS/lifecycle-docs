import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

To **tear down** an environment, you can do one of the following:

1. **Merge or close the pull request**: This will automatically clean up the environment.
2. **Apply the `lifecycle-disabled!` label**: This will immediately trigger the environment deletion process.

---

The **`lifecycle-disabled!`** label is useful in scenarios where:

- The environment infrastructure is **experiencing issues**.
- The data within the environment is **corrupt**.
- You need to **restart or rebuild** the environment from scratch without waiting for a PR to be merged or closed.

Simply apply the label to the **PR associated with the environment**, and Lifecycle will automatically tear it down.

Using these methods, you can efficiently manage and clean up environments to ensure smooth development and testing workflows. ðŸ§¹

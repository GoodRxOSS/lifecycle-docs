Now that we've created and deployed our first Lifecycle environment, let's learn how to customize it by configuring services and dependencies.

## Understanding Configuration

First, let's take a look at the `lifecycle.yaml` configuration file at the root dir of [lifecycle-examples](https://github.com/GoodRxOSS/lifecycle-examples/blob/main/lifecycle.yaml) repository:

```yaml filename="lifecycle.yaml"
environment:
  autoDeploy: true
  defaultServices:
    - name: "frontend"
    - name: "backend"
  optionalServices:
    - name: "cache"

services:
  - name: "frontend"
    defaultUUID: "dev-0"
    github:
      repository: "iceycake/lifecycle-examples"
      branchName: "main"
      docker:
        builder:
          engine: "buildkit"
        defaultTag: "main"
        app:
          dockerfilePath: "Dockerfile.frontend"
          ports:
            - 3000
          env:
            COMPONENT: "app"
            ENV: "lifecycle"
            API_URL: "https://{{{backend_publicUrl}}}"
            CACHE_URL: "{{{cache_internalHostname}}}"
            WES_IS: "GOAT"
  - name: "backend"
    requires:
      - name: "db"
    defaultUUID: "dev-0"
    # ...
  - name: "db"
    defaultUUID: "dev-0"
    # ...
  - name: "cache"
    defaultUUID: "dev-0"
    # ...
```

### Default and Optional Services

We have our dependencies defined in **`defaultServices`** and **`optionalServices`**:

- **`defaultServices`** ‚Äì These services are always **built and deployed** with the environment. They form the core foundation of the environment and are required for it to function correctly.
- **`optionalServices`** ‚Äì These services **can be built on demand**, only when explicitly needed. If they are not selected during a PR, they default to using a **static environment** (e.g., `dev-0`).

### Template Variables

Notice how there are template variables defined in service named `frontend` > `github.docker.env`:

```yaml
API_URL: "https://{{{backend_publicUrl}}}"
CACHE_URL: "{{{cache_internalHostname}}}"
```

This `API_URL` and `CACHE_URL` variables are dynamically templated by Lifecycle and provided during the **build** and **deploy** steps for the frontend service.

</Callout>

## Static Environment as a Fallback

Since `cache` is an **optional service**, this service defaulted to using a **static environment**(`dev-0`) as a fallback. This allows us to reuse existing environments instead of rebuilding everything from scratch when there are no changes.

### Check Template Variables

To view how the fallback URL works,

1. Open your **Tasks App**(frontend) from the deployed environment.
2. Navigate to the `Variables` page.
3. Search for `_URL` and check its value.
   - It should look like:
     ```
     API_URL: https://backend-<build_uuid>.<your_domain>
     CACHE_URL: cache-dev-0.env-dev-0.svc.cluster.local
     ```
   - Notice how `CACHE_URL` defaults to the `dev-0`(static) environment for the optional cache.

## Configuring Services

Now, let's say you also want to the `cache` component to **test, build and deploy it in your environment**.

### Enable Cache Deployment

1. Navigate to the **Lifecycle PR comment** on GitHub.
2. Select the `cache` checkbox in the comment. That's it!
3. Lifecycle will now start **building and deploying the cache service** for your specific environment.
4. Wait for the build to complete. You can monitor the progress in the **status comment**.

### Confirm the New Cache URL

5. Once the cache is deployed, go back to your **frontend app‚Äôs Variables page**.
6. Check the `CACHE_URL` value.
   - It should now look like:
     ```
     cache-<build_uuid>.env-<build_uuid>.svc.cluster.local
     ```
7. Now, you're running your cache **from your own environment** instead of an existing static deploy!
8. Check the application‚Äôs **Tasks** page while you‚Äôre here and observe the completely different data, as this environment uses a freshly built and seeded database.

## Build Flexible Environments

With this approach, you can:

- Build **any combination** of frontend and backend services.
- Use **custom branches** for different services.
- Test **different versions** of your app.

<Callout type="info">
  Check how to use Mission Control comments for configuring your environment
  [here](/docs/tips/using-mission-control)
</Callout>

This gives you a **custom, isolated testing environment** that mirrors your
production setup while allowing flexibility in development and validation.

## Summary

- Services marked as **optional** in `lifecycle.yaml` will default to static environments unless explicitly built.
- You can enable/disable any service directly from the **Lifecycle PR comment**.
- Lifecycle automates dependency management, ensuring your services deploy in the correct order.

**Now you're ready to customize your Lifecycle environments like a pro!** üë©‚Äçüíª

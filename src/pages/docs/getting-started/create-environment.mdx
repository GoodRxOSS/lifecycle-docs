In this walk through, we will make a simple change to an example frontend repository and create our first ephemeral environment using Lifecycle.

## 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the [`lifecycle-examples`](https://github.com/GoodRxOSS/lifecycle-examples) repository to your org or personal account and install your newly minted GitHub App to the forked repository.

- Navigate to `https://github.com/settings/apps` (for personal accounts) or `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps` (for org accounts).
- Find the **Lifecycle GitHub App** and click on **Edit**.
- Choose `Install App` from sidebar and click the Settings <Settings className="inline" /> icon.
- Select the forked repository from the list and select **Save**.

## 2. Create a New Branch

Clone the repo and create a branch named `lfc-config`:

```sh
git checkout -b lfc-config
```

or if you are using GitHub Desktop, you can create a new branch from the UI.

## 3. Update Lifecycle Configuration

Open the `lifecycle.yaml` file in the root of the repository and update the `frontend` service's repository to your github username or org.

**Before:**

```yaml filename="lifecycle.yaml"
github:
  repository: "GoodRxOSS/lifecycle-examples"
```

**After:**

```yaml filename="lifecycle.yaml"
github:
  repository: "<your-github-username>/lifecycle-examples"
```

## 4. Commit & Push Your Changes

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "update config"
git push origin lfc-config
```

## 5. Create a Pull Request

1. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from `lfc-config` to `main` in the forked repository.
2. Submit the PR.

## 6. Lifecycle PR Comment

After submitting the PR, you‚Äôll see a **GitHub comment from Lifecycle** on your pull request.

üîπ This PR comment is the **mission control** for your ephemeral environment. It provides:

- A **status update** of the build and deploy process.
- A **list of services** configured for the environment.
- A **link to the Lifecycle UI** where you can view logs, deployments, and environment details.

<Callout type="error">
  If there is no comment from Lifecycle, it means the app is not configured
  correctly or the GitHub App is not installed in the repository. Please refer
  to the [Missing Comment](/docs/troubleshooting/github-app-webhooks) page for
  more information.
</Callout>

## 7. Add `lifecycle-status-comments!` label

The additional label `lifecycle-status-comments!` provides more detailed information about the environment status and links to access the running application.

üîπ The comments provides insights into:

- **Build & Deploy Status**: Track when your environment is ready.
- **Environment URLs**: Access the running frontend app.
- **Telemetry Links**: Links to telemetry, build and deploy logs. (if enabled)

## 8. Wait for Deployment

Wait for the **builds & deploys** to complete. Once the status updates to **`deployed`**, your environment is live! üöÄ

When a new commit is pushed to your pull request Lifecycle automatically builds and deploys again so you always have the latest version of the application.

<Callout type="info" icon={Info}>
  If there are any errors during the build or deploy process, the environment
  will not be created, and you will see an error message in the Lifecycle
  comment.
  <br />
  <div>
    You can check the logs from `lifecycle-worker` pods in your cluster to debug
    the issue: <br /> `kubectl logs deploy/lifecycle-worker -n lifecycle-app -f
    `
  </div>
</Callout>

## 9. Checkout the deployed application

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your environment at the URL provided in the Lifecycle comment on your pull request. Click on the `frontend` link to open your application in a new tab.

The application has two simple pages:

- **`/tasks`** ‚Äì A simple to-do list.
- **`/variables`** ‚Äì Displays all environment variables from the container.

## Next Steps

Now that your first ephemeral environment is ready, move on to the next section where we:

üß™ Test the environment.<br />
üß≠ Explore the comments and logs.<br />
‚öôÔ∏è Customize the configuration.

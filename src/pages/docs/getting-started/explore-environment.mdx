Now that we've deployed our first Lifecycle environment, let‚Äôs take a tour of the PR comments to understand how to interact with our ephemeral environment.

## Test Your Application

Let's navigate to the deployed `frontend` app from the PR comment.

1. Click on the `frontend` link in the PR comment to navigate to your deployed application.
2. Add a task and complete few tasks to update data in backend.
3. Navigate to the `variables` page and checkout the variables in your application's container.
4. Thats it! You have successfully deployed and tested the best todo app in the world! üéâ

## Mission Control Comment

The **Lifecycle PR comment** in your pull request serves as the **mission control** for your ephemeral environment.

  ratio={2106 / 2278}
/>

### What You Can Do in the PR Comment

- **Editable Checkboxes**: Select or deselect services to include in your environment.
- **Redeploy Checkbox**: Triggers a redeploy (useful for transient issues).
- **Deployment Section**: Provides URLs to your **deployed services**.

<Callout type="info" emoji={<Info />}>

</Callout>

## Status Comment

When we add the `lifecycle-status-comments!` label to our pull request, Lifecycle will automatically add a **status comment** to the PR.

This comment provides real-time updates on the status, links to your deployments including the build progress and service statuses.

  height={894}
  ratio={1902 / 894}
/>

Notice the following while the environment is being built:

- The status comment is **updated in real-time**.
- The **status** of each service is displayed.
- The **build logs** are available for each service.

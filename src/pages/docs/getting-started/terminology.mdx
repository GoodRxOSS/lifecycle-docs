# Terminology

## Quick Reference

| Term            | Definition                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Environment** | A stack of connected services (ephemeral or static)     |
| **Service**     | A deployable artifact (Docker, Helm, GitHub, etc.)      |
| **Build**       | The process instance that builds and deploys services   |
| **Deploy**      | Execution of a single service within a build            |
| **Repository**  | A GitHub repo registered with Lifecycle                 |
| **UUID**        | Unique identifier for builds (e.g., `arm-model-060825`) |

## Core Concepts

### Environment

A stack of services built and connected together. Two types exist:

| Type          | Lifespan                   | Use Case                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Ephemeral** | Tied to PR lifecycle       | Feature branch testing         |
| **Static**    | Long-lived (e.g., `dev-0`) | Fallback for optional services |

Environments define **defaultServices** (always deployed) and **optionalServices** (deployed on demand).

### Service

A deployable artifact defined in `lifecycle.yaml`.

| Type            | Description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `docker`        | Container built from a Dockerfile     |
| `github`        | Built from GitHub source code         |
| `helm`          | Helm chart deployment                 |
| `codefresh`     | Codefresh pipeline-managed deployment |
| `configuration` | Configuration-only (no build)         |

A single repository can contain multiple services.

### Build

The process instance that builds and deploys all services in an environment. Each build:

- Has a unique UUID (e.g., `arm-model-060825`)
- Contains one deploy per service
- Tracks overall environment status

### Deploy

The execution of a single service within a build. Manages building the Docker image and deploying to Kubernetes.

## Status Reference

### Build Status

<Mermaid

    pending --> queued --> building --> built --> deploying --> deployed
    deployed --> tearing_down --> torn_down
    deployed --> error
    deployed --> config_error
`}
/>

| Status         | Meaning                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `pending`      | Being prepared                |
| `queued`       | Waiting to be processed       |
| `building`     | Docker images building        |
| `built`        | All images built successfully |
| `deploying`    | Deploying to Kubernetes       |
| `deployed`     | All services running          |
| `tearing_down` | Being deleted                 |
| `torn_down`    | Fully deleted                 |
| `error`        | Build or deploy failed        |
| `config_error` | Invalid `lifecycle.yaml`      |

### Deploy Status

| Status          | Meaning                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `pending`       | Waiting to start             |
| `queued`        | In the queue                 |
| `cloning`       | Cloning source code          |
| `building`      | Building Docker image        |
| `built`         | Image built                  |
| `deploying`     | Deploying to Kubernetes      |
| `ready`         | Running and healthy          |
| `waiting`       | Waiting for dependencies     |
| `build_failed`  | Image build failed           |
| `deploy_failed` | Kubernetes deployment failed |
| `error`         | Unexpected error             |
| `torn_down`     | Service removed              |

## GitHub Integration

### Labels

| Label                        | Effect                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `lifecycle-deploy!`          | Triggers deployment              |
| `lifecycle-disabled!`        | Deletes the environment          |
| `lifecycle-keep!`            | Prevents TTL cleanup             |
| `lifecycle-status-comments!` | Enables detailed status comments |

### Mission Control Comment

Posted by Lifecycle on your PR. Provides:

- Build status and service URLs
- Checkboxes to enable/disable services
- Configuration overrides

### Webhooks

Invoke external services on build state changes. Example uses:

- Trigger E2E tests when `deployed`
- Send notifications on `error`

---

## Infrastructure

### Namespace

Kubernetes namespace where your environment runs. Format: `env-<uuid>`

### UUID

Human-readable identifier using haikunator pattern (e.g., `arm-model-060825`). Used for:

- Environment identification
- Namespace naming
- URL generation

### Template Variables

Placeholders resolved at build time:

| Variable                         | Resolves To                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `{{{service_publicUrl}}}`        | Public URL of a service      |
| `{{{service_internalHostname}}}` | Internal Kubernetes hostname |

### TTL (Time-To-Live)

Automatic cleanup of inactive environments.

- **Inactivity period**: 14 days
- **Check interval**: 4 hours
- **Override**: Add `lifecycle-keep!` label

### Capacity Type

| Type        | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ON_DEMAND` | Standard, always-available compute  |
| `SPOT`      | Cost-effective (may be interrupted) |

This glossary provides an overview of key Lifecycle concepts and terminology. Let's see how they fit into the environment setup and deployment process.

## Repository

A **repository** refers to a GitHub repository. Each environment that is built **must** have a default repository and an associated pull request.

## Service

A **service** is a deployable artifact. It can be a Docker container, CI pipeline, RDS database, or Helm chart. A single repository can contain multiple services.

**Example:** <br/>
`frontend-service` and `frontend-cache` are two services required for the frontend application to function correctly.

## Environment

An **environment** is a stack of services built and connected together.

- **`defaultServices`** are built and deployed in an environment by default.
- **`optionalServices`** can be built and deployed only when needed; otherwise, they fallback to the **default static environment**.

## Static Environment

A **static environment** is a long-lived environment based on a pull request. It tracks branches from configured services and updates automatically when new changes are merged.

## Build

A **build** is the actual instance of the process to build and deploy services within an environment.

- Each build is uniquely identified by Lifecycle using a UUID (e.g., `arm-model-060825` or `dev-0`).
- A build contains **one deploy per service** in the configuration.

## Deploy

A **deploy** manages the build and deployment execution of a service within an environment.

**Example:**<br/>
In a frontend environment, `frontend-service` and `frontend-cache` are two deploys created for the environment, each mapped to a unique build UUID.

## Webhook

Lifecycle can invoke third-party services when a build state changes. Currently, only **Codefresh triggers** are supported.

### Example

- When the build status is `deployed`, trigger end-to-end tests.
- When the build status is `error`, trigger infrastructure cleanup.

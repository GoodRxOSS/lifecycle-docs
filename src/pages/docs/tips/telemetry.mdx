Lifecycle comes with built-in support for Datadog telemetry. To collect logs and metrics from your cluster and deployed applications, install the Datadog Agent and Cluster Agent in your cluster.

The deployed applications are already configured with the necessary Datadog labels and environment variables for seamless integration:

**Pod labels:**

```yaml
tags.datadoghq.com/env: lifecycle-binlab-zero-101010
tags.datadoghq.com/service: frontend
tags.datadoghq.com/version: binlab-zero-101010
```

**Environment variables:**

```yaml
- name: DD_ENV
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/env']
- name: DD_SERVICE
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/service']
- name: DD_VERSION
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      fieldPath: metadata.labels['tags.datadoghq.com/version']
```

This setup ensures that Datadog automatically detects the environment, service, and version for each application, enabling rich observability and correlation of logs and metrics in the Datadog platform.

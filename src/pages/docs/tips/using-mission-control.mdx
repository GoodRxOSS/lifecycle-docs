Lifecycle uses **Mission Control PR Comments** to allow users to modify and customize their environments directly from the pull request comment. This enables easy **service selection**, **branch customization**, and **environment variable overrides** without modifying `lifecycle.yaml`.

---

## Selecting and Deselecting Services

Each pull request environment includes **default services** and optional additional services. You can enable or disable services using the checkboxes.

- **Enabled Services** are marked with `[x]`.
- **Disabled Services** are marked with `[ ]`.

**Example:**

```md
// Default Services

- [x] frontend: dev-default
- [x] fastly: main

// Optional Additional Services

- [ ] backend-service: main
- [ ] backend-db: main
- [ ] backend-cache: main
```

To **enable** a service, change `[ ]` to `[x]`. To **disable** a service, change `[x]` to `[ ]`. As simple as that!

<Callout type="warning">
  If you need to make multiple selections or deselections at once, use the
  **Edit Comment** option instead of clicking checkboxes individually. This
  prevents multiple back-to-back builds, as each selection triggers an event in
  Lifecycle without deduplication.
</Callout>

## Choosing a Branch

To deploy a specific branch for a service, modify the branch name after the service name.

**Example:**

```md
- [x] frontend: feature-branch
- [x] fastly: main
```

This will deploy `frontend` using the `feature-branch` instead of the default branch.

## Overriding Environment Variables

To set additional environment variables, use the **Override Environment Variables** section in the PR comment.

**Example:**

```md
// **Override Environment Variables:** _ENV:[KEY]:[VALUE]_
ENV:API_URL:https://api.custom.dev.0env.com
ENV:CHIEF_INTERN:ICEYCAKE
```

This sets `API_URL` and `CHIEF_INTERN` in the environment without modifying the service configuration.

## Override UUID

To set a custom UUID (subdomain) for the environment, use the **Override UUID** section in the PR comment.

```md
// UUID (Pick your own custom subdomain)
url: wagon-builder-060825
```

Replace `wagon-builder-060825` with your desired subdomain. This allows you to customize the environment URL without changing the underlying service configuration.

Using the **Mission Control PR Comment**, you can easily customize your environment **without modifying code**, making it a flexible way to test and deploy changes dynamically.

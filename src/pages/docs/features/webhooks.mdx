Lifecycle can invoke **third-party services** when a build state changes. Currently, only **Codefresh pipeline triggers** are supported. Webhooks allow users to automate external processes such as running tests or performing cleanup tasks based on environment build states.

## Common Use Cases

- When a build status is `deployed`, trigger **end-to-end tests**.
- When a build status is `error`, trigger **infrastructure cleanup** or alert the team.

## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks are defined in the `lifecycle.yaml` under the `environment.webhooks` section.

Below is an example configuration for triggering end-to-end tests when the `deployed` state is reached.

### **Examples**

```yaml
# Trigger End-to-End Tests on Deployment
environment:
  # ...
  defaultServices:
    - name: "frontend"
  optionalServices:
    - name: "backend"
      repository: "lifecycle/backend"
      branch: "main"
  webhooks:
    - state: deployed
      type: codefresh
      name: "End to End Tests"
      pipelineId: 64598362453cc650c0c9cd4d
      trigger: tests
      env:
        branch: "{{frontend_branchName}}"
        TEST_URL: "https://{{frontend_publicUrl}}"
  # ...
```

- **`state: deployed`** → Triggers the webhook when the build reaches the `deployed` state.
- **`type: codefresh`** → Specifies that this webhook triggers a **Codefresh pipeline**.
- **`name`** → A human-readable name for the webhook.
- **`pipelineId`** → The unique Codefresh pipeline ID.
- **`trigger`** → Codefresh pipeline's trigger to execute.
- **`env`** → Passes relevant environment variables (e.g., `branch` and `TEST_URL`).

```yaml
# Trigger Cleanup on Build Error
environment:
  # ...
  webhooks:
    - state: error
      type: codefresh
      name: "Cleanup Failed Deployment"
      pipelineId: 74283905723ff650c0d9ab7e
      trigger: cleanup
      env:
        branch: "{{frontend_branchName}}"
        CLEANUP_TARGET: "frontend"
  # ...
```

- **`state: error`** → Triggers the webhook when the build fails.
- **`type: codefresh`** → Invokes a Codefresh cleanup pipeline.
- **`trigger: cleanup`** → Codefresh pipeline's trigger to execute.
- **`env`** → Includes necessary variables, such as `branch` and `CLEANUP_TARGET`.

## Limitations

- **Currently, Lifecycle only supports Codefresh pipeline triggers.**
- In need of support for other webhook types? please **submit a pull request or an issue**.

By leveraging webhooks, teams can **automate workflows, run tests, and clean up failed deployments** seamlessly within Lifecycle.

Lifecycle can invoke **third-party services** when a build state changes.

Webhooks allow users to automate external processes such as running tests, performing cleanup tasks, or sending notifications based on environment build states.

## Supported Types

Lifecycle supports three types of webhooks:

1. **`codefresh`** - Trigger Codefresh pipelines
2. **`docker`** - Execute Docker images as Kubernetes jobs
3. **`command`** - Run shell commands in a specified Docker image

## Common Use Cases

- When a build status is `deployed`, trigger **end-to-end tests**.
- When a build status is `error`, trigger **infrastructure cleanup** or alert the team.
- Run **security scans** on built containers.
- Execute **database migrations** after deployment.
- Send **notifications** to Slack, Discord, or other communication channels.
- Perform **smoke tests** using custom test containers.

## Configuration

Webhooks are defined in the `lifecycle.yaml` under the `environment.webhooks` section.

Below is an example configuration for triggering end-to-end tests when the `deployed` state is reached.

## Examples

### `codefresh`

The `codefresh` type triggers existing Codefresh pipelines when build states change.

```yaml
# Trigger End-to-End Tests on Deployment
environment:
  # ...
  defaultServices:
    - name: "frontend"
  optionalServices:
    - name: "backend"
      repository: "lifecycle/backend"
      branch: "main"
  webhooks:
    - state: deployed
      type: codefresh
      name: "End to End Tests"
      pipelineId: 64598362453cc650c0c9cd4d
      trigger: tests
      env:
        branch: "{{frontend_branchName}}"
        TEST_URL: "https://{{frontend_publicUrl}}"
  # ...
```

- **`state: deployed`** â†’ Triggers the webhook when the build reaches the `deployed` state.
- **`type: codefresh`** â†’ Specifies that this webhook triggers a **Codefresh pipeline**.
- **`name`** â†’ A human-readable name for the webhook.
- **`pipelineId`** â†’ The unique Codefresh pipeline ID.
- **`trigger`** â†’ Codefresh pipeline's trigger to execute.
- **`env`** â†’ Passes relevant environment variables (e.g., `branch` and `TEST_URL`).

---

```yaml
# Trigger Cleanup on Build Error
environment:
  # ...
  webhooks:
    - state: error
      type: codefresh
      name: "Cleanup Failed Deployment"
      pipelineId: 74283905723ff650c0d9ab7e
      trigger: cleanup
      env:
        branch: "{{frontend_branchName}}"
        CLEANUP_TARGET: "frontend"
  # ...
```

- **`state: error`** â†’ Triggers the webhook when the build fails.
- **`type: codefresh`** â†’ Invokes a Codefresh cleanup pipeline.
- **`trigger: cleanup`** â†’ Codefresh pipeline's trigger to execute.
- **`env`** â†’ Includes necessary variables, such as `branch` and `CLEANUP_TARGET`.

### `docker`

The `docker` type allows you to execute any Docker image as a Kubernetes job when build states change.

<Callout type="info">
  Docker webhooks run as Kubernetes jobs in the same namespace as your build.
  They have a default timeout of 30 minutes and resource limits of 200m CPU and
  1Gi memory.
</Callout>

```yaml
# Run E2E Tests in Custom Container
environment:
  # ...
  webhooks:
    - name: "E2E Test Suite"
      description: "Execute comprehensive E2E tests"
      state: deployed
      type: docker
      docker:
        image: "myorg/e2e-tests:latest"
        command: ["npm", "run", "e2e"]
        timeout: 1200 # 1 hour (optional, default: 1800 seconds)
      env:
        BASE_URL: "https://{{frontend_publicUrl}}"
        ENVIRONMENT: "ephemeral"
```

- **`docker.image`** â†’ Docker image to execute (required)
- **`docker.command`** â†’ Override the default entrypoint (optional)
- **`docker.args`** â†’ Arguments to pass to the command (optional)
- **`docker.timeout`** â†’ Maximum execution time in seconds (optional, default: 1800)

### `command`

The `command` type is a simplified version of Docker webhooks, ideal for running shell scripts or simple commands.

```yaml
# Slack Notification Example
environment:
  # ...
  webhooks:
    - name: "Deployment Notification"
      description: "Notify team of successful deployment"
      state: deployed
      type: command
      command:
        image: "alpine:latest"
        script: |
          apk add --no-cache curl
          curl -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{\"text\":\"ðŸš€ Deployed $SERVICE_NAME to $DEPLOY_URL\"}"
        timeout: 300 # 5 minutes (optional)
      env:
        WEBHOOK_URL: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ"
        SERVICE_NAME: "{{frontend_internalHostname}}"
        DEPLOY_URL: "https://{{frontend_publicUrl}}"
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to replace placeholder values like webhook URLs and pipeline IDs
  with your actual values.
</Callout>

- **`command.image`** â†’ Docker image to run the script in (required)
- **`command.script`** â†’ Shell script to execute (required)
- **`command.timeout`** â†’ Maximum execution time in seconds (optional, default: 1800)

## Trigger states

Webhooks can be triggered on the following build states:

- **`deployed`** â†’ Service successfully deployed and running
- **`error`** â†’ Build or deployment failed
- **`torn_down`** â†’ Environment has been destroyed

## Note

- All webhooks for the same state are executed **serially** in the order defined.
- Webhook failures do not affect the build status.
- Webhook invocations can be viewed at `/builds/[uuid]/webhooks` page(latest 20 invocations). Use the API to view all invocations.
- `docker` and `command` type's logs are not streamed when the job is still in progress and are available only after the job completes.

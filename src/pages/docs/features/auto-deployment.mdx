## Auto-Deploy Configuration

To enable **automatic deployment** when a PR is created, set the `autoDeploy` attribute in your repository's `lifecycle.yaml` file:

```yaml {2} filename="lifecycle.yaml"
environment:
  autoDeploy: true
  defaultServices:
```

- Lifecycle will **automatically create** the environment as soon as a PR is opened.
- A `lifecycle-deploy!` label will be added to the PR to indicate that the environment has been deployed.

---

## Managing Deployments with Labels

If **auto-deploy is not enabled**, you can manually control the environment using PR labels.

### Deploy an Environment

To create an ephemeral environment for a PR, **add** the `lifecycle-deploy!` label.

### Tear Down an Environment

To **delete** an active environment, use either of these labels:

- **Remove** `lifecycle-deploy!`
- **Add** `lifecycle-disabled!`

---

## Automatic Cleanup on PR Closure

When a PR is **closed**, Lifecycle will:

1. **Tear down** the active environment.
2. **Remove** the `lifecycle-deploy!` label from the PR.

This ensures that unused environments do not persist after the PR lifecycle is complete.

## Summary

| Feature                      | Behavior                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `autoDeploy: true` in config | PR environments are **automatically** deployed. |
| `lifecycle-deploy!`          | **Manually deploy** an environment.             |
| Remove `lifecycle-deploy!`   | **Tear down** the environment.                  |
| Add `lifecycle-disabled!`    | **Tear down** the environment manually.         |
| PR closed                    | **Environment is deleted automatically**.       |

Using these configurations and labels, teams can efficiently manage **ephemeral environments** in their development workflow.
